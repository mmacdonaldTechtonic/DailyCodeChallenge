# DailyCodeChallenge

A record of Daily Challenges starting the last week of April 2021.  These will be gathered from a smattering of resources, starting with [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), maybe some from [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/tracks), and maybe [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) as well.  I'll mostly be completing these in javascript.

Challenges completed in Java have a small console app.  Javascript ones are mostly completed in the challenge site or in [Replit](https://replit.com/), but can be run with `node <file path>` (must have node installed.  I'm currently using node 12.22.1).
